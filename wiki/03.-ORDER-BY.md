## Sorting Results Using ORDER BY

In SQL Server, the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results of a query by one or more columns. You can specify whether you want to sort the results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. If no direction is specified, the default sort order is ascending.

### Basic Usage of ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause is placed at the end of the SQL query, after all other clauses such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `GROUP BY`. You can sort by one or more columns, either in ascending or descending order.

### Examples

**Sorting by a Single Column in Ascending Order:**

**Sorting by a Single Column in Ascending Order:**

```sql
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
**Sorting by Multiple Columns**

If you want to sort by multiple columns, separate them with a comma. For example, you can first sort by `date` and then by `location`. This order specifies that if two records have the same `date`, they will be further sorted by `location`.

```sql
ORDER BY date ASC, location ASC;
```
**Sorting by Derived Columns and Aliases**

You can also sort by derived columns or aliases created in the query. For example, you can create a derived column `city` as an alias and sort the results by this alias in descending order.

```sql
SELECT date, locationas city, prcp
FROM data_new
ORDER BY city DESC;
```
