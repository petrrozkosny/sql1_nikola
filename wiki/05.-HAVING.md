## Filtering Grouped Data Using HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used in SQL to filter results that have been grouped using `GROUP BY`. Unlike the `WHERE` clause, which filters rows before grouping, `HAVING` filters groups after applying aggregate functions.

### When to Use HAVING

- **After Using `GROUP BY`**: `HAVING` is often used in combination with `GROUP BY` to restrict results based on aggregate functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
- **To Filter Based on Aggregate Results**: For example, if you want to display only those groups where the count of items in a particular group is greater than a certain value.

The `HAVING` clause is useful when you need to apply conditions to summary results, which cannot be done with `WHERE`, as `WHERE` cannot work with aggregate functions.

### Example of Using HAVING

```sql
SELECT location,
       SUM(prcp) AS sum_prcp, 
       AVG(prcp) AS avg_prcp, 
       MAX(prcp) AS max_prcp
FROM data_new
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(prcp) > 5
```
